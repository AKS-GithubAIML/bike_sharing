# Project Name: Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Problem Statement
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes is looking forward for below problem statements to improve his service for a better profitable business in market
> 1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
> 2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
